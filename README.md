This project is a user-friendly landing page for an online bicycle shop. The goal was to create an engaging and intuitive interface that allows potential customers to easily explore the shop's offerings and make informed purchasing decisions.

Project Overview:
Purpose: To design and develop a modern landing page that effectively showcases the products of an online bicycle shop, focusing on user experience and visual appeal.

Technologies Used:

HTML: The structure of the page was built with semantic HTML, ensuring that the content is organized and         accessible.

CSS/SCSS: SCSS was used to create a clean and maintainable stylesheet, leveraging features like variables, nesting, and mixins to streamline the styling process.

BEM (Block Element Modifier): The BEM methodology was applied to keep the codebase modular and easy to understand, allowing for consistent naming conventions and reusable components.

Key Features:
Responsive Design: The landing page is fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across a range of devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

Interactive Elements: The site includes interactive features like producthover effects, and a smooth scrolling experience to enhance user engagement.

User-Centered Navigation: The navigation is designed to be intuitive, guiding users through the site with ease and helping them find the information they need quickly.

Visual Appeal: The design is modern and clean, with a focus on high-quality images and clear typography, aligning with the brand identity of the bicycle shop.

Design Reference:
Figma Mockup: The design of the landing page was based on a Figma mockup, which served as the blueprint for the project. This mockup includes all visual elements, layouts, and interactions that were implemented in the final product.
